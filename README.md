# Topic

EVENFLO Maternity Products

We selected this topic because the database helps us to focus our analysis on an e-commerce launch plan

# Objective of the project

Analyze the distribution channels, through the sales channels provided by the Kimberly Clark company. The main objective is to carry out an analysis of how to introduce the main products or star products (feeding bottles, training cups, nipples and bibs) through E-Commerce, since most of the products are distributed through self-service or specialized services. The goal is to ensure that the target, in this case, new mothers or those who have babies between 1 and 3 years old, can easily acquire our products.

# Data source

The data was generated in a fictitious way, the information was investigated and organized, so that we could offer information on the true products offered by the brand, but emphasizing that the figures are totally invented by the work team.

# Question to answer

° Based on a portfolio analysis for each channel, which is the ideal portfolio for launching Maternity Products on e-commerce?

° Is it possible to develop a promotion plan for tops sellers across channels?

° Can we identify any trend that should be reflected on the sales plan for the first semester of 2023?

# Analysis of the 4 sub-segments of EVENFLO

Tableau was used as an option since it is a tool in business development. The app makes it easy to explore and manage data. It also enables faster discovery and sharing of information to drive big business change.

An analysis was carried out to know the behavior of the products during the first semesters of 2021 and 2022. Within this analysis, an attempt was also made to highlight the main cities in Mexico such as CDMX, Monterry and Guadalajara.

This in order to be able to validate the channels mostly used for the commercialization of the main 4 products.
