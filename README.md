#Objective of the project

Analyze the distribution channels, through the sales channels provided by the Kimberly Clark company. The main objective is to carry out an analysis of how to introduce the main products or star products (feeding bottles, training cups, nipples and bibs) through E-Commerce, since most of the products are distributed through self-service or specialized services. The goal is to ensure that the target, in this case, new mothers or those who have babies between 1 and 3 years old, can easily acquire our products.

#Data source

The data was generated in a fictitious way, the information was investigated and organized, so that we could offer information on the true products offered by the brand, but emphasizing that the figures are totally invented by the work team.
